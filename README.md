This program is our chess game application that was built in Java using excellent design principles. The Phase 0 folder contains our CRC cards, our progress report and project specification. The Phase 1 folder contains our Design Document corresponding to work done up up till phase 1. The Phase 2 folder contains the final Design Document. The src folder contains the source code of our application and the test folder contains unit tests to check for the validity of our code such that it applies the correct rules and logic of chess. 

To start playing our chess game:
1. Navigate to the 'src' folder
2. Run the class "Main"
3. Enjoy the game!
